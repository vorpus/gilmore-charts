"1656","LORELAI"," That's OK. Rory can pick something else.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1657","EMILY"," Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. (to Rory) You can use your mother's old golf clubs. They're upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1685","LORELAI"," She won't enjoy it, Mom.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1686","EMILY"," Well why don't you just let Rory decide?","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1687","LORELAI"," Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won't tell you that she doesn't want to go becasue she's too afraid of hurting your feelings.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1693","LORELAI"," I'm there.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1695","LORELAI"," You're just going to twist it all around, aren't you?","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1696","EMILY"," And you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion on this. She'd be miserable and you know it.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1697","LORELAI"," I am so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"11645","MISS PATTY"," This, boys and girls, is the story of true love. A beautiful girl from one county; a handsome boy from another. They meet and they fall in love. Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars.

And to make it interesting, we should come up with like a reward system so once we’re done with everything on the list we could go get manicures or we could go to the Swiss place for fondue for dinner or we could stuff our purses full of sour patch kids and milk duds and go see the Stars Hollow elementary school production of ‘Who’s afraid of Virginia Woolfe.’","raw/s01e17.txt"
