"1656","LORELAI"," That's OK. Rory can pick something else.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1657","EMILY"," Why should she pick something else? She needs to learn a sport and Richard can teach her a sport. (to Rory) You can use your mother's old golf clubs. They're upstairs gathering dust along with the rest of her potential.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1685","LORELAI"," She won't enjoy it, Mom.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1686","EMILY"," Well why don't you just let Rory decide?","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1687","LORELAI"," Because Rory is the sweetest kid in the whole world and she won't tell you that she doesn't want to go becasue she's too afraid of hurting your feelings.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1693","LORELAI"," I'm there.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"1695","LORELAI"," You're just going to twist it all around, aren't you?","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1696","EMILY"," And you know your daughter so well that you don't even have to ask her opinion on this. She'd be miserable and you know it.","raw/s01e03.txt"
"1697","LORELAI"," I am so setting myself up here, but yes, she would be miserable.","raw/s01e03.txt"

"11645","MISS PATTY"," This, boys and girls, is the story of true love. A beautiful girl from one county; a handsome boy from another. They meet and they fall in love. Separated by distance and by parents who did not approve of the union, the young couple dreamed of a day that they could be together. They wrote each other beautiful letters. Letters of longing and passion. Letters full of promises and plans for the future. Soon the separation proved too much for either one of them to bear. So, one night, cold and black with no light to guide them, they both snuck out of their homes and ran away as fast as they could. It was so dark out that they were both soon lost and it seemed as if they would never find each other. Finally, the girl dropped to her knees, tears streaming down her lovely face. 'Oh, my love. Where are you? How will I find you?' Suddenly, a band of stars appeared in the sky. These stars shone so brightly they lit up the entire countryside. The girl jumped to her feet and followed the path of the stars until finally she found herself standing right where the town gazebo is today. And there waiting for her was her one true love, who had also been led here by the blanket of friendly stars.

And to make it interesting, we should come up with like a reward system so once we’re done with everything on the list we could go get manicures or we could go to the Swiss place for fondue for dinner or we could stuff our purses full of sour patch kids and milk duds and go see the Stars Hollow elementary school production of ‘Who’s afraid of Virginia Woolfe.’","raw/s01e17.txt"

His plays were meant to be experienced, lived. So with that in mind, together with my third period Shakespeare, you'll be split up into five groups and each group will assume responsibility for one act of Romeo and Juliet, which will be performed a week from Sunday. You will nominate the director, you will cast the scene, rehearse the scene, and interpret the scene in your own individual manner. Last year, we did Richard the Third. One group did their scene as the Mafiosi. Another set theirs during the Roman Empire. And my favorite, the climactic last scene was set during the final days of the Sonny and Cher show. Just remember, whatever interpretation you choose should highlight the themes you see in the scene. And if the love of the Bard's language still doesn't inspire you, remember this will be fifty percent of your final grade.","raw/s02e09.txt"

So, I arranged to meet the CEO yesterday just to talk about the situation and about the rumors I'd heard floating around. So I met with Floyd. We shook hands, had coffee, then I started telling him about how unhappy I'd become. I detailed all my years with the company, all the travel I'd done, all the weekends I put in, the sacrifices I'd made, including time with my family, for the firm. And the more I talked, the angrier I became, and then suddenly I heard myself resign, just like that. Floyd was stunned. I'd never seen Floyd stunned. I enjoyed seeing Floyd stunned. So I finished my coffee and I walked out of that office, and I couldn't believe what I'd just done. I'd resigned, quit. I believe I even used a little profanity in the process. But you know what Emily? I was thrilled, elated, a giant weight had been lifted off my chest","raw/s02e10.txt"

And you like order, you like lists, you like to know where you're going or what's coming. You like all things planned. And then suddenly I impulsively unplan our entire future in one fail swoop. Well, I couldn't face disappointing you again. I couldn't face telling you that I'd spoiled the plan. Not now, not at this time of year. I didn't want to fight, I didn't want to worry, I just wanted to keep being happy. I'm very, very sorry. Anyhow, um, I've been sitting here going over our financial situation. Now, um, we still have all of our retirement accounts, and our medical coverage is all there, By quitting though, we do forgo some of my pension and some stock options.

"32949","PARIS"," The average teenager spends seven hours a day at school. Seven hours where he or she is busy walking from class to class – indoors, outdoors, in all types of weather. At the same time, that same teenager is going through major physical changes within his or her own body. The combo of the action with the environment in addition to the hormonal imbalance can only lead to one thing – accidents.","raw/s02e18.txt"
"32950","MADELINE"," What are you talking about?","raw/s02e18.txt"
"32951","PARIS"," Monday morning, Muffin wakes up and looks in the mirror. ‘Oh no, I have a zit on my face. I’ll just look down when I walk so hunky football player won’t notice.’ And bam – Muffin smacks right into the cafeteria wall. Ouch, that’s gotta hurt.","raw/s02e18.txt"
"32952","MADELINE"," Who’s Muffin?","raw/s02e18.txt"
"32953","PARIS"," This is why I’m proposing manufacturing something that no teenager should be without – a first aid kit.","raw/s02e18.txt"
"32954","LOUISE"," A first aid kit?","raw/s02e18.txt"

"32960","PARIS"," Possibly.","raw/s02e18.txt"

Plus, we use neon bandaids, pink or blue gauze for the bandages, anything that seems young or flashy or bright.","raw/s02e18.txt"
